#+TITLE: Hacking on the Guix Workflow Language

* Development environment

You can use Guix to set up a development environment:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
guix environment --load=.guix.scm
#+END_SRC

* Commit access

The Guix Workflow Language is [[https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gwl][hosted on Savannah]].  All commits that
are pushed to the central repository must be signed with an OpenPGP
key, and the public key should be uploaded to your user account on
Savannah and to public key servers, such as ‘pgp.mit.edu’.  To
configure Git to automatically sign commits, run:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git config commit.gpgsign true
git config user.signingkey CABBA6EA1DC0FF33
#+END_SRC

When pushing a commit on behalf of somebody else, please add a
Signed-off-by line at the end of the commit log message (e.g. with
‘git am --signoff’).  This improves tracking of who did what.
