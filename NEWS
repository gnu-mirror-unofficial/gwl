* Changes since 0.2.1
** Command line interface
- Add sub-commands “run”, “graph”, and “web”; remove options from the main command.
- =guix/scripts/workflow.scm= no longer exists.  The file is now called =gwl/main.scm=.  The entry point, however, is now =guix/extensions/workflow.scm=, and it is invoked with =guix workflow= when the directory is found on the new =GUIX_EXTENSIONS_PATH= environment variable (since Guix commit cf289d7cfa34315bf13b3114b9a5bf3d3c05ebea).
** Web interface
- GWL source snippets now have better syntax highlighting.
** Bug fixes
- handle caching of files with UTF-8 encoded file names
- handle more errors in the web interface

* Changes in 0.2.1 (since 0.2.0)
** Documentation
- additional documentation of the “run-time” field and the “complexity” type
- added example of how to use =pick= with local variable definitions
** Bug fixes
- due to a faulty condition (a test whether a file is a directory),
  process outputs were never cached.  The condition has been
  corrected.
- outputs with absolute file names are no longer considered missing
- workflows without inputs no longer trigger an error
* Changes in 0.2.0 (since 0.1.1)
** Command line interface
  * Remove the “guix process” command.
  * Remove GUIX_WORKFLOW_PATH; load workflows from files instead.
  * Add --container flag to enable process isolation
** Workflow syntax
  * Support Wisp syntax in workflow files.
  * Add syntactic sugar for defining workflows and processes.
  * Support syntax for procedures written in languages other than Guile.
  * Add graph syntax to specify process dependencies.
  * Add “auto-connect” helper to automatically link up process inputs and outputs.
  * Deprecate the “restrictions” field in workflow records in favor of “auto-connect” and “graph” syntax in the “processes” field.
  * Fields of the “process” form that expect lists now also accept multiple values.
  * Add “on” procedure for application of higher-order functions to collections
  * Add “expand” procedure to expand variables in file name templates
** Execution engines
  * Add simple execution engine and use it by default instead of the bash-engine.
** Programming interface
  * Remove modules “(guix processes)” and “(guix workflows)”.  Use “(gwl processes)” and “(gwl workflows)” instead.
  * Remove “define-dynamically” macro
  * Use GOOPS instead of “(guix records)”
** Documentation
  * Add manual in Texinfo format
* Changes in 0.1.1 (since 0.1.0)
  * Disable interpreting shell escape characters.
  * Show more information in error messages.
* Changes in 0.1.0 (since 0.0.9)
  * Improve readability of text in the web interface.
  * Make the “run-time” field optional for “process” descriptions.
  * Hide version information in process and workflow overviews.
  * Don't rely on G-Expressions -- generate Guix profiles instead.
* Changes in 0.0.9 (since 0.8.0)
  * Disable grafts.
* Changes in 0.0.8 (since 0.0.7)
  * Pass a name in Grid Engine commands.
* Changes in 0.0.7 (since 0.0.6)
  * Maintain the current working directory when computing remotely.
* Changes in 0.0.6 (since 0.0.5)
  * Fix bugs in the web interface.

* Changes in 0.0.3 (since 0.0.1)
  * Keep GWL compatible with Guix changes.
