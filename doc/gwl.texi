@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

This package provides the @dfn{Guix Workflow Language} (GWL), a
scientific computing extension to the Guix package manager.  It
combines the specification of work units and their relationship to one
another with the reproducible software deployment facilities of the
functional package manager GNU Guix.  A GWL workflow will always run
in a reproducible environment that GNU Guix automatically prepares.
The GWL extends your Guix installation with a single new sub-command:
@code{guix workflow}.

In the GWL there are two concepts we need to know about: processes and
workflows.  We describe a computation (running a program, or
evaluating a Scheme expression) using a process.  A workflow describes
how individual processes relate to each other (e.g. ``process B must
run after process A, and process C must run before process A'').

GWL workflows are executable code.  The workflow language is embedded
in the powerful general purpose language
@url{https://gnu.org/software/guile/, Guile Scheme}, so you can
compute arbitrarily complex process and workflow definitions.  The GWL
supports a classic Lisp syntax as well as a Python-like syntax called
@url{https://www.draketo.de/light/english/wisp-lisp-indentation-preprocessor,Wisp}.

@c *********************************************************************
@node Installation
@chapter Installation

There really is no point in using the GWL without Guix.  If you
already have a Guix installation, you can install the GWL with
@code{guix install gwl}.

The Guix Workflow Language uses the GNU build system.  To install it
from a release tarball just unpack it and run the usual commands:

@cindex installing from source
@cindex building from source
@example
./configure
make
make install
@end example

If you want to build the sources from the source repository you need to
bootstrap the build system first.  Run @code{autoreconf -vif} first and
then perform the above steps.

Note that in order for Guix to learn about the ``workflow''
sub-command provided by the GWL, the Guile module @code{(guix scripts
workflow)} must be found in a directory on the @code{GUILE_LOAD_PATH}.

@c *********************************************************************
@node A Simple Workflow
@chapter A Simple Workflow

To get a little taste of what the workflow language looks like, let's
start by writing a simple workflow.

Here is a simple workflow example:

@example
@verbatiminclude examples/simple-wisp.w
@end example

This white-space sensitive syntax is called Wisp and if you're familiar
with Python or YAML you should feel right at home.  To use this syntax
simply save your workflow to a file ending on @file{.w}, @file{.wisp},
or @file{.gwl}.

The workflow language really is a @dfn{domain specific language} (DSL)
embedded in Guile Scheme, so if you're a Lisper you may prefer to write
your workflows directly in Scheme while basking in its parenthetical
glow:

@example
@verbatiminclude examples/simple.scm
@end example

Everything you can express in Scheme can also be expressed with the Wisp
syntax, so the choice is down to personal preference.

@c *********************************************************************
@node Defining a Process
@chapter Defining a Process

@cindex defining processes
In the GWL a ``process'' is a combination of some kind of command or
script to be executed, the software packages that need to be available
when executing the commands, and declarations of inputs and generated
outputs.  A process has a name, and optionally a synopsis and a
description, for display purposes.

@cindex make-process, constructor
We create a process with the @code{make-process} constructor like
this:

@example
make-process
  name "hello"
  procedure
     ' display "hello"
@end example

This creates a process with the name ``hello'', which will print the
string @code{"hello"} once the process is executed.  The
@code{procedure} field holds the Scheme code that does all the work of
saying ``hello''.  We will talk about the @code{procedure} field a
little later and show how to write code snippets in languages other
than Scheme.

Often we will want to refer to previously created processes later, for
example to combine them in a workflow definition.  To do that we need
to bind the created processes to variable names.  Here we bind the
above process to a variable named @code{hello}:

@example
define hello
  make-process
    name "hello"
    procedure
       ' display "hello"
@end example

@cindex process, constructor
@cindex process, definition macro
This is a very common thing to do, so the GWL offers a shorter syntax
for not only creating a process but also binding it to a variable.
The following example is equivalent to the above definition:

@example
process hello
  procedure
     ' display "hello"
@end example


@node @code{process} Fields
@section @code{process} Fields
@cindex process, valid fields
Both @code{make-process} and @code{process} accept the same fields,
which we describe below.

@table @code
@cindex name, process field
@item name
The readable name of the process as a string.  This is used for
display purposes and to select processes by name.  When the
@code{process} constructor is used, the @code{name} field need not be
provided explicitly.

@cindex version, process field
@item version
This field holds an arbitrary version string.  This can be used to
disambiguate between different implementations of a process when
searching by name.

@cindex synopsis, process field
@item synopsis
A short summary of what this process intends to accomplish.

@cindex description, process field
@item description
A longer description about the purpose of this process.

@cindex packages, process field
@item packages
This field is used to specify what software packages need to be
available when executing the process.  Packages can either be Guix
package specifications --- such as the string @code{"guile@@3.0"} for
Guile version 3.0 --- or package variable names.  When using package
variable names, you need to make sure to import the appropriate Guix
module at the top of your workflow file, e.g. @code{(import (gnu
packages guile))} for the variable @code{guile}.

@cindex implicit list, process.packages
The @code{packages} field accepts a list of packages as well as
multiple values (an ``implicit list'').  All of the following
specifications are valid.  A single package:

@example
process
  packages "guile"
  @dots{}
@end example

More than one package:

@example
process
  packages "guile" "python"
  @dots{}
@end example

A single list of packages:

@example
process
  packages
    list "guile" "python"
  @dots{}
@end example

@cindex inputs, process field
@item inputs
This field holds inputs to the process.  Commonly, this will be a list
of file names that the process requires to be present.  The GWL can
automatically connect processes by matching up their declared inputs
and outputs, so that processes generating certain outputs are executed
before those that declare the same item as an input.

As with the @code{packages} field, the @code{inputs} field accepts an
``implicit list'' of multiple values as well as an explicit list.
@cindex tagged lists
@cindex named items, lists
@cindex tagged items, lists
Additionally, individual inputs can be ``tagged'' or named by
prefixing it with a keyword (@pxref{Keywords,,,guile,GNU Guile
Reference Manual}).  Here's an example of an implicit list of inputs
spread across multiple lines where two inputs have been tagged:

@example
process
  inputs
    . genome: "hg19.fa"
    . "cookie-recipes.txt"
    . samples: "foo.fq"
  @dots{}
@end example

The leading period is Wisp syntax to continue the previous line.  You
can, of course, do without the periods, but this may look a little
more cluttered:

@example
process
  inputs genome: "hg19.fa" "cookie-recipes.txt" samples: "foo.fq"
  @dots{}
@end example

@cindex pick, items from a tagged list
@cindex select, tagged items in a list
Why tag inputs at all?  Because you can reference them in other parts
of your process definition without having to awkwardly traverse the
whole list of inputs.  Here is one way to select the first input that
was tagged with the @code{samples:} keyword:

@example
pick genome: inputs
@end example

To select the second item after the tag @code{genome:} do this:

@example
pick second genome: inputs
@end example

or using a numerical zero-based index:

@example
pick 1 genome: inputs
@end example

@ref{Code Snippets} for a convenient way to access named items in code
snippets without having to define your picks beforehand.

@cindex outputs, process field
@item outputs
This field holds a list of outputs that are expected to appear after
executing the process.  Usually this will be a list of file names.
Just like the @code{inputs} field, this field accepts a plain list, an
implicit list of one or more values, and lists with named items.

The GWL can automatically connect processes by matching up their
declared inputs and outputs, so that processes generating certain
outputs are executed before those that declare the same item as an
input.

@cindex output-path, process field
@item output-path
This is a directory prefix for all outputs.

@cindex run-time, process field
@item run-time
This field is used to specify run-time resource estimates, such as the
memory requirement of the process or the maximum time it should run.
This is especially useful when submitting jobs to an HPC cluster
scheduler such as Grid Engine, as these schedulers may give higher
priority to jobs that declare a short run time.

@cindex time, complexity
@cindex space, complexity
@cindex threads, complexity
@cindex seconds, run-time specification
@cindex minutes, run-time specification
@cindex hours, run-time specification
@cindex kibibytes, memory specification
@cindex kilobytes, memory specification
@cindex mebibytes, memory specification
@cindex megabytes, memory specification
@cindex gibibytes, memory specification
@cindex gigabytes, memory specification
Resources are specified as a complexity value with the fields
@code{space} (for memory requirements), @code{time} (for the expected
duration of the computation), and @code{threads} (to control the
number of CPU threads).  For convenience, memory requirements can be
specified with the units @code{kibibytes} (or @code{KiB}),
@code{mebibytes} (or @code{MiB}), or @code{gibibytes} (or @code{GiB}).
Supported time units are @code{seconds}, @code{minutes}, and
@code{hours}.

Here is an example of a single-threaded process that is granted 20 MiB
of run-time memory for a duration of 10 seconds:

@example
process stamp-inputs
  inputs "first" "second" "third"
  outputs "inputs.txt"
  run-time
    complexity
      space 20 mebibytes
      time  10 seconds
      threads 1
  # @{ echo @{@{inputs@}@} > @{@{outputs@}@} @}
@end example

When this process is executed by a scheduler that honors resource
limits, the process will be granted at most 20 MiB of memory and will
be killed if it has not concluded after 10 seconds.

@cindex procedure, process field
@item procedure
This field holds an expression of code that should be run when the
process is executed.  This is the ``work'' that a process should
perform.  By default that's a quoted Scheme expression, but code
snippets in other languages are also supported (@pxref{Code
Snippets}).

Here's an example of a process with a procedure that writes a haiku to
a file:

@example
process haiku
  outputs "haiku.txt"
  synopsis "Write a haiku to a file"
  description
    . "This process writes a haiku by Gary Hotham \
to the file \"haiku.txt\"."
  procedure
    ` with-output-to-file ,outputs
        lambda ()
          display "\
the library book
overdue?
slow falling snow"
@end example

The Scheme expression here is quasiquoted (with a leading @code{`}) to
allow for unquoting (with @code{,}) of variables, such as
@code{outputs}.

Not always will Scheme be the best choice for a process procedure.
Sometimes all you want to do is fire off a few shell commands.  While
this is, of course, possible to express in Scheme, it is admittedly
somewhat verbose.  For convenience we offer a simple and surprisingly
short syntax for this common use case.  As a bonus you can even leave
off the field name ``procedure'' and write your code snippet right
there.  How?  @ref{Code Snippets}.
@end table

@c TODO: document the accessor procedures

@node Process templates
@section Process templates
@cindex process templates
@cindex generating processes

When defining many similar processes, it can be useful to parameterize
a single process template.  This can be accomplished by defining a
procedure that takes any number of arguments and returns a
parameterized process.  Here's how to do this somewhat verbosely in
plain Scheme:

@lisp
(define (build-me-a-process thing)
  "Return a process that displays THING."
  (make-process
    (name (string-append "show-" thing))
    (procedure `(display ,thing))))

;; Now use this procedure to build concrete processes.
(define show-fruit
  (build-me-a-process "fruit"))
(define show-kitchen
  (build-me-a-process "kitchen"))
(define show-table
  (build-me-a-process "table"))
@end lisp

As this is a somewhat common thing to do in real workflows, the GWL
provides simplified syntax to express the same concepts with a little
less effort:

@example
process build-me-a-process (with thing)
  name
    string-append "show-" thing
  procedure
    ` display ,thing

define show-fruit
  build-me-a-process "fruit"
define show-kitchen
  build-me-a-process "kitchen"
define show-table
  build-me-a-process "table"
@end example

The result is the same: you get a procedure @code{build-me-a-process}
that you can use to define a number of similar processes.  In the end
you have the three processes @code{show-fruit}, @code{show-kitchen},
and @code{show-table}.

@node Useful procedures
@section Useful procedures
@cindex (gwl utils)
@cindex Helper procedures
@cindex Utilities

The @code{(gwl utils)} module provides a number of useful helpers that
are intended to simplify common tasks when defining processes.  The
helpers defined by this module are all available by default.

@cindex on, helper procedure
@cindex reorder higher order function application
@deffn {Scheme Procedure} on @var{collection} @var{higher} @var{proc}
The @code{on} procedure is an alternative way to express the
application of a higher order function to some collection.  The only
purpose of this procedure is to improve legibility when using Wisp
syntax, as it allows one to avoid leading dots.  The following two
expressions are equivalent:

@example
;; With "on"
on numbers map
   lambda (number)
     + number 10

;; Without "on"
map
  lambda (number)
    + number 10
  . samples
@end example
@end deffn

@cindex expand, helper procedure
@cindex expand file name templates
@cindex file name expansion
@deffn {Scheme Procedure} expand @var{file-name-part}@dots{}
This procedure returns a list of file names by combining any number of
file name parts given as arguments.  A file name part can either be a
string or a list of strings.  This is very useful when you need to
generate a list of input or output file names.

@example
(expand "/home/"
        '("me" "you" "them")
        "/data/"
        '("old" "new"))

=> '("/home/me/data/old"
     "/home/me/data/new"
     "/home/you/data/old"
     "/home/you/data/new"
     "/home/them/data/old"
     "/home/them/data/new")
@end example
@end deffn

@cindex pick, helper procedure
@cindex pick elements from a list
@cindex select tagged items
@deffn {Scheme Procedure} pick [@var{n}] @var{key} @var{collection}
This procedure allows you to pick a named item from a @var{collection}
by looking for the specified keyword @var{key}.  Optionally, you can
provide a selector procedure or index @var{n} as the first argument.
Without a selector the first item matching the given @var{key} will be
returned.  When the selector is @code{*} all items following the
@var{key} (up to the next tag) will be returned.  If the selector is a
number it is used as a zero-based index into the list of items
following the @var{key}.  If the selector is a procedure it is applied
to the list of items following the @var{key}.

@example
define collection
  list
    . "one"
    . "two"
    . "three"
    . mine: "four"
    . "five"
    . yours: "six"

pick mine: collection

; => "four"

pick * mine: collection

; => '("four" "five")

pick second mine: collection

; => "five"

pick 0 yours: collection

; => "six"
@end example
@end deffn

@cindex load-workflow
@cindex load a workflow
@deffn {Scheme Syntax} load-workflow @var{file}
This macro lets you load a workflow from the given @var{file}.  The
file must evaluate to a workflow value.  This macro is useful for when
you want to extend previously defined workflows.  The argument
@var{file} is expected to be a file name relative to the file invoking
@code{load-workflow}.
@end deffn

@c *********************************************************************
@node Code Snippets
@chapter Code Snippets

@cindex scripts, embedding
@cindex code snippets
@cindex special syntax, code snippets
@cindex language support, code snippets
@cindex Python, code snippets
@cindex R, code snippets
@cindex shell snippets
The Guix Workflow Language is embedded in Guile Scheme, so it makes
sense to use Scheme to define the work that a process should perform.
Sometimes it may be more convenient, though, to express the procedure in
a different language, such as GNU R, Python, or maybe even in Bash.

The GWL provides special syntax for embedding code snippets.  The
special syntax is provided in the @code{(gwl sugar)} module, and is
loaded by default.  Here is an example of a process that runs an
embedded Bash shell script:

@example
process run-bash
  packages "bash"
  # bash @{ echo "hello from bash!" @}
@end example

Notice how the ``procedure'' field name was not used here, because the
code snippet came last.  This cuts down on boilerplate.

Code snippets are introduced with @code{# interpreter @{}, where
@code{interpreter} is the command line for running an interpreter, such
as @code{/bin/bash -c}.  Code snippets must end with a closing brace,
@code{@rbracechar{}}.

Make sure that the package inputs include a package providing the
interpreter.  For convenience we provide the special interpreters
@code{bash}, @code{R}, and @code{python}, so that you don't have to
specify a more complicated command line.  When no interpreter is
provided the generic shell interpreter @code{/bin/sh} will be used:

@example
process run-sh
  # @{ echo "hello from a shell!" @}
@end example

@cindex string interpolation, code snippets
@cindex accessing variables, code snippets
Within code snippets a special syntax is supported for accessing
variables.  Any uninterrupted value enclosed in double braces is
considered a reference to a variable, which may also be the name of
other process fields.  In the following example, the shell snippet
refers to the @code{name} and @code{inputs} fields of the current
process:

@example
process run-bash
  packages "bash"
  inputs
    . "a"
    . "b"
    . "c"
  # bash @{
    echo "The name of this process: @{@{name@}@}."
    echo "The data inputs are: @{@{inputs@}@}."
  @}
@end example

@cindex accessing named values in variables, code snippets
You can even access named or tagged values in lists.  In the following
example, the shell snippet refers to only selected values of the
@code{inputs} field of the current process:

@example
process run-bash
  packages "bash"
  inputs
    . "a"
    . mine: "b"
    . "c"
    . yours: "d"
  # bash @{
    echo "This is mine: @{@{inputs:mine@}@}, and this is yours: @{@{inputs:yours@}@}."
  @}
@end example

As expected, this will output the following text when run:

@example
This is mine: b, and this is yours: d.
@end example

@cindex accessing multiple named values, code snippets
You can also access tagged sub-lists with the @code{::} accessor:

@example
process frobnicate
  packages "frobnicator"
  inputs
    . genome: "hg19.fa"
    . samples: "a" "b" "c"
  outputs
    . "result"
  # @{
    frobnicate -g @{@{inputs:genome@}@} --files @{@{inputs::samples@}@} > @{@{outputs@}@}
  @}
@end example

This process will cause the following command to be executed:

@example
frobnicate -g hg19.fa --files a b c > result
@end example

If these two ways to access elements of a list are not enough, we
recommend defining a variable using @code{pick} (@ref{Useful
procedures}).  In the following example we define a variable
@var{second-sample} inside of the @code{procedure} field to hold the
second of the inputs after the keyword @code{samples:}, i.e. the
string @code{the}.  We can then refer to that variable by name in the
code snippet.

@example
process foo
  inputs
    . "something"
    . samples: "in" "the" "way"
  procedure
    define second-sample
      pick second samples: inputs
    # @{ echo @{@{second-sample@}@} @}
@end example

@cindex environment variables, code snippets
@cindex process meta data, code snippets
You can also access process meta data through environment variables.
The following variables may be set:

@itemize
@item @code{_GWL_PROCESS_NAME}
@item @code{_GWL_PROCESS_SYNOPSIS}
@item @code{_GWL_PROCESS_DESCRIPTION}
@item @code{_GWL_PROCESS_INPUTS}
@item @code{_GWL_PROCESS_OUTPUT_PATH}
@item @code{_GWL_PROCESS_OUTPUTS}
@item @code{_GWL_PROCESS_COMPLEXITY_TIME}
@item @code{_GWL_PROCESS_COMPLEXITY_SPACE}
@item @code{_GWL_PROCESS_COMPLEXITY_THREADS}
@end itemize

@node Defining a Workflow
@chapter Defining a Workflow

@cindex defining a workflow
@cindex combining processes in a workflow

A workflow is a combination of processes that run in a certain order
or simultaneously.  You can specify the dependencies of processes
manually or let the GWL figure it out by matching up the declared
inputs and outputs of all processes.

A workflow definition will look something like this:

@example
workflow do-stuff
  processes
    . this
    . that
    . something-else
@end example

This defines a workflow with the name ``do-stuff'', binds it to a variable
@code{do-stuff}, and declares that it consists of the three processes
@code{this}, @code{that}, and @code{something-else}.  All of these
processes will be run at the same time.  This may not be what you want
when the processes depend on each other.

@cindex auto-connect, workflow order
If the processes all declare inputs and outputs, the GWL can connect
the processes and ensure that only independent processes are run
simultaneously.  Use the @code{auto-connect} procedure on your
processes:

@example
workflow do-stuff
  processes
    auto-connect
      . this
      . that
      . something-else
@end example

@cindex graph, workflow order
You can also explicitly construct a graph of processes with the aptly
named @code{graph} macro.  The following workflow definition lets the
process @code{combine} run after @code{generate-A} and
@code{generate-B}, which will both run in parallel.  The process
@code{compress} will run after @code{combine}, and thus at the very
end.

@example
workflow frobnicate
  processes
    graph
      combine -> generate-A generate-B
      compress -> combine
@end example

@node Process Engines
@chapter Process Engines

@cindex executing processes
@cindex simple-engine, Process Engine
Once you have defined a workflow, there are different ways to run the
processes it consists of.  The simplest way is to turn the workflow into
a Guile script that sets up the desired environment and then executes
the workflow processes on the current machine.  This is what the
@code{simple-engine} does.

@cindex grid-engine, Process Engine
The @code{grid-engine} is similar to the @code{simple-engine} in that
it generates a shell script, with the difference that it also includes
resource variable definitions for submission to a Grid Engine
scheduling system.  The resource variables are derived from the
process @code{run-time} field.

@node Invoking guix workflow
@chapter Invoking @command{guix workflow}

The Guix Workflow Language extends your Guix installation with a new
command: @command{guix workflow}.  There are three sub-commands:

@table @code
@item run
To run (or prepare to run) a workflow from a file.
@item graph
Load a workflow from a file and generate a graph in Graphviz Dot-format.
@item web
The GWL includes a web interface.  This command starts it.
@end table

@node Options for guix workflow run
@section Options for @code{guix workflow run}

This is the command to run (or prepare to run) a workflow from a file.
It generate the process scripts, builds or downloads all dependencies,
and then runs the workflow process scripts corresponding to the
workflow defined in the given file.

The following options can be provided to change the behavior of this
command.

@table @code
@item --input=@var{name}[=@var{file}]
@itemx -i @var{name}[=@var{file}]
A workflow may have so-called free inputs, inputs that are not
provided by any of the workflow's processes.  By default, the GWL will
pick files from the current working directory that match the names of
free inputs.  This option can be used to map a @var{file} with an
arbitrary name to a free input in the workflow with the given
@var{name}.  This option can be provided more than once.

In the following example, the free input called @code{genome} is
mapped to the file @file{/data/hg19.fa} before running the workflow
defined in @file{analysis.w}:

@example
guix workflow run --input=genome=/data/hg19.fa analysis.w
@end example

@item --output=@var{location}
@itemx -o @var{location}
This option currently has no effect.

@item --engine=@var{engine}
@itemx -e @var{engine}
Select the process engine @var{engine} as the target of the generated
process scripts. See @ref{Process Engines}.

@c TODO: how does this differ from ``--dry-run''?
@item --prepare=@var{file}
@itemx -p @var{file}
Generate the process scripts and build or download all dependencies,
but do not run the workflow process scripts corresponding to the
workflow defined in @var{file}.

@item --dry-run
@itemx -n
Prepare the scripts and the environments but don't actually run the
processes.  Only show what commands would be run.

@item --force
@itemx -f
Execute all processes, even if their outputs may have been cached from
previous runs.

@cindex container
@cindex user namespaces
@cindex isolate processes
@item --container
@itemx -c
Run each process inside of an isolated environment with file system
virtualization and user namespaces.  Only declared input files will be
available at execution time, and only declared output files will be
stored.  This is a great option to use when you want to make sure that
your processes only depend on state that you have declared.  A
downside is that generated output files cannot be written to the
target directories directly but are copied from the container to the
file system.

@node Options for guix workflow web
@section Options for @code{guix workflow web}

@table @code
@item --port=@var{port}
@itemx -p @var{port}
The network port on which the web interface listens for connections.

@item --host=@var{host}
@itemx -H @var{host}
The network host on which to listen for connections.  This defaults to
@code{localhost}.

@item --workflows-directory=@var{location}
This is a location containing other workflows that the web interface
may access to visualize them.
@end table

The following options are only rarely used:

@table @code
@item --max-file-size=@var{bytes}
The maximum size (in bytes) of files served by the web interface.

@item --dot=@var{/path/to/dot}
Use this to provide an alternative variant of the @file{dot} executable.

@item --root=@var{location}
Use this to override the root location of the workflow web interface.

@item --assets-directory=@var{location}
Use this to override the location of web assets (CSS, JavaScript,
images).

@item --examples-root-directory=@var{location}
Use this to override the default name of the directory containing
workflow examples.
