@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

This package provides the @dfn{Guix Workflow Language} (GWL), a
scientific computing extension to the Guix package manager.  It combines
the specification of work units and their relationship to one another
with the reproducible software deployment facilities of the functional
package manager GNU Guix.

In the GWL there are two concepts we need to know about: processes and
workflows.  We describe a computation (running a program, or evaluating
a Scheme expression) using a process.  A workflow describes how multiple
processes relate to each other (e.g. ``process B must run after process
A, and process C must run before process A'').

To make processes and workflows available to the GWL via Scheme or the
command line, we write them as @ref{Creating Guile Modules,,,guile,
Guile Scheme modules}.  Processes or workflows can be run
programmatically using the @code{process->script->run} and
@code{workflow-run} procedures, or on the command line by using the
@code{guix process} and @code{guix workflow} commands.


@c *********************************************************************
@node Installation
@chapter Installation

The Guix Workflow Language uses the GNU build system.  To install it
from a release tarball just unpack it and run the usual commands:

@cindex installing from source
@cindex building from source
@example
./configure
make
make install
@end example

If you want to build the sources from the source repository you need to
bootstrap the build system first.  Run @code{autoreconf -vif} first and
then perform the above steps.


@c *********************************************************************
@node A Simple Workflow
@chapter A Simple Workflow

To get a little taste of what the workflow language looks like, let's
start by writing a simple workflow.  The workflow language is a
@dfn{domain specific language} (DSL) embedded in Guile Scheme.

Here is a simple workflow example:

@example
@verbatiminclude examples/simple.scm
@end example

If you prefer a white-space sensitive syntax like that of Python or YAML
over the native syntax of Scheme, you can use the Wisp syntax extension
in files ending on @file{.w}, @file{.wisp}, or @file{.gwl}.  Here is the
same workflow written in Wisp:

@example
@verbatiminclude examples/simple-wisp.w
@end example

@c *********************************************************************
@node Code Snippets
@chapter Code Snippets

@cindex scripts, embedding
@cindex code snippets
@cindex special syntax, code snippets
@cindex language support, code snippets
@cindex Python, code snippets
@cindex R, code snippets
@cindex shell snippets
The Guix Workflow Language is embedded in Guile Scheme, so it makes
sense to use Scheme to define the work that a process should perform.
Sometimes it may be more convenient, though, to express the procedure in
a different language, such as GNU R, Python, or maybe even in Bash.

The GWL provides special syntax for embedding code snippets.  The
special syntax is provided in the @code{(gwl sugar)} module.  Here is an
example of a process that runs an embedded Bash shell script:

@example
import
  gwl processes
  gwl sugar

process: run-bash
  package-inputs : list "bash"
  procedure # /bin/bash -c
echo "hello from bash!"
##
@end example

Code snippets are introduced with @code{# interpreter}, where
@code{interpreter} is the command line for running an interpreter, such
as @code{/bin/bash -c}.  Make sure that the package inputs include a
package providing the interpreter.  For convenience we provide the
special interpreters @code{R} and @code{python}, so that you don't have
to specify a more complicated command line.

Code snippets must end with a line consisting only of @code{##}.

@cindex environment variables, code snippets
@cindex process meta data, code snippets
Within code snippets you can access process meta data through
environment variables.  The following variables may be set:

@itemize
@item @code{_GWL_PROCESS_NAME}
@item @code{_GWL_PROCESS_SYNOPSIS}
@item @code{_GWL_PROCESS_DESCRIPTION}
@item @code{_GWL_PROCESS_DATA_INPUTS}
@item @code{_GWL_PROCESS_OUTPUT_PATH}
@item @code{_GWL_PROCESS_OUTPUTS}
@item @code{_GWL_PROCESS_COMPLEXITY_TIME}
@item @code{_GWL_PROCESS_COMPLEXITY_SPACE}
@item @code{_GWL_PROCESS_COMPLEXITY_THREADS}
@end itemize

@c *********************************************************************
@node Process Engines
@chapter Process Engines

@cindex executing processes
@cindex simple-engine, Process Engine
Once you have defined a workflow, there are different ways to run the
processes it consists of.  The simplest way is to turn the workflow into
a Guile script that sets up the desired environment and then executes
the workflow processes on the current machine.  This is what the
@code{simple-engine} does.

@cindex grid-engine, Process Engine
The @code{grid-engine} is similar to the @code{simple-engine} in that it
generates a shell script, with the difference that it also includes
resource variable definitions for submission to a Grid Engine scheduling
system.  The resource variables are derived from the process complexity
field.
